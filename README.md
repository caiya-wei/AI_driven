# EDIRN

We provide the Python 3.7 scripts used to reproduce the results in the main text. 
They are written and tested on a computer with Intel i7-13700KF (CPU), RTX 3060ti (GPU) and 32 GB (RAM). 
No particular hardware is required to run them.
However, depending on the CPU and GPU performances, the code may take several days to run for large time steps.
