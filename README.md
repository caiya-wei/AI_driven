# EDIRN

We provide the Python 3.7 scripts used to reproduce the results in the main text. 
They are written and tested on a computer with Intel i7-13700KF (CPU), RTX 3060ti (GPU) and 32 GB (RAM). 
No particular hardware is required to run them.
However, depending on the CPU performance, the code may take several days to run for large time steps. 

# Software Requirements

1. Windows 11
2. Python 3.7

# Python Dependencies

numpy 

networkx

pandas 

scipy


# Simulation Guide
With main.py and main_xx.py, we calculate the fixation probability of cooperators on random and empirical networks, which reproduces the results of Figs. 2 - 5.
